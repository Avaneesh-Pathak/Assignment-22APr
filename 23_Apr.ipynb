Overfitting occurs when the model fits the noise in the data instead of the underlying patterns, while underfitting occurs when the model fails to capture the underlying patterns and relationships between the input features and the output variable. Balancing the dimensionality of the data with the complexity of the model is important to avoid overfitting and underfitting. Dimensionality reduction techniques can help to reduce the dimensionality of the data and improve the accuracy and interpretability of the model."
